Problem: 
Write a model called Performance which has cost, revenue and creation date. Add a new field for profit, which is the spread between revenue and costs. Extend this class with two other classes HourlyPerformance, DailyPerformance. HourlyPerformance has to have a datetime field called datetime. DailyPerformance has to have a date field called date. Please note, any migration hasnâ€™t been performed yet and the model Performance doesn't need to be in the db. Create a method called filter_by_min_roi(min_roi: float)  so you can do DailyPerformance.objects.filter_by_min_roi(min_roi=0.5)
